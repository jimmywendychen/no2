Asian cucumber salad  Ingredients: 3/4 large Cucumber 1 packet Shiritaki Noodles
2 tbsp. Coconut Oil 1 medium Spring Onion 1/4 tsp. Red Pepper Flakes 1 tbsp. Sesame Oil 1 tbsp. Rice Vinegar 1 tsp. Sesame Seeds Salt and Pepper to Taste
Method: STEP 1 Remove shiritaki noodles from the package and rise off completely. This may take a few minutes, but make sure that all of the extra water that came in its package is washed off. STEP 2 Set noodles on a kitchen towel and thoroughly dry them. STEP 3 Bring 2 tbsp. Coconut Oil to medium-high heat in a pan. STEP 4 Once the oil is hot, add noodles and cover (it will splatter). Let these fry for 5-7 minutes or until crisp and browned. STEP 5
Remove shiritaki noodles from the pan and set on paper towels to cool and dry.
STEP 6 Slice cucumber thin and arrange on a plate in the design you’d like.
STEP 7 Add 1 medium Spring Onion, 1/4 tsp. Red Pepper Flakes, 1 tbsp. Sesame Oil, 1 tbsp. Rice Vinegar, 1 tsp. Sesame Seeds, and Salt and Pepper to taste. You can also pour over the coconut oil from the pan you fried the noodles in. This will add a salty component so keep that in mind. Store this in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before serving!
